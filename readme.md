In fact ,this is a wifi sniffer. It sniffs out the wifi signals of smartphones in its range to make a rough count of traffic. Compared to the camera, or security door, smaller, hidden, easy to carry.
This project is changed from [ESP-EOS/ESP32-WiFi-Sniffer](https://github.com/ESP-EOS/ESP32-WiFi-Sniffer)


## Equipment list

- [MakePython ESP32](https://www.makerfabs.com/makepython-esp32.html)
- [MakePython A9G GPRS/GPS Expansion](https://www.makerfabs.com/makepython-a9g-gprs-gps-shield.html)

SD card reader modules such as MakePython Audio are available, but require pin changes.

- Micro SD Card




# STEPS
